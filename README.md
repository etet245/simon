# Simon

Here's the interactive memory game from the 80's brought back to life in code! This was the final project of freeCodeCamp's Front End curriculum. See it live [here](etet245.github.io/simon).

This was an exercise for me to really get down into the details of emulating a design, as well as creating a smooth user experience, and I must say I'm pretty proud of the result.
