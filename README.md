# Simon

Here's the interactive memory game from the 80's brought back to life in code! Turn on the game, press START, and follow the instructions, if you can keep up! Game speeds up at level 5, 9, and 13. Beat level 20 for victory! For an extra challenge, try STRICT mode!

This was the final project of freeCodeCamp's Front End curriculum. It was an exercise for me to really get down into the details of emulating a design without looking at source code, as well as creating a smooth user experience, and I must say I'm pretty proud of the result. You can try both below!
